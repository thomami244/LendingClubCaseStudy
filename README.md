## General Information
- This project analyzes loan data to understand the driving factors behind loan defaults.
- **Background:** The analysis is conducted for a consumer finance company specializing in various types of loans to urban customers.
- **Business Problem:** The company needs to minimize financial losses due to loan defaults by identifying risky loan applicants.
- **Dataset:** The dataset includes information about past loan applicants and their repayment status, sourced from the company's loan records.

## Conclusions
- **Income Analysis:** Annual income categories play a crucial role in determining financial stability and lending decisions.
- **Loan Term Impact:** Loans with different terms (36 or 60 months) show varying default rates, affecting repayment capacity assessment.
- **Credit History:** Longer credit histories and fewer recent delinquencies indicate lower default risks.
- **Verification Status:** Verified income and employment statuses ensure higher credibility and lower default risks.
